Task description
Bus charter company wants to provide new service for travel agencies â€“ draft ticket price.
To receive draft ticket price, following data must be provided:
- List of passengers
- List of luggage items of each passenger
Draft ticket price is calculated as following:
1. Base price for an adult is provided by already existing service returning number from database based on given route (bus terminal name).
2. Infant passengers receive 50% discount.
3. Luggage price is 30% of base price.
4. Tax rates are provided by already existing service, which provides list of percentage rates on given day of purchase.
The result of calculation should contain both total price and prices for each individual item.
Needed functionality
Task is to design input and output data structure and implement functionality for calculating the draft price for a ticket.
API for base price service and tax rate service can be assumed as needed.
No GUI is needed, policy data will be sent through the API directly to the methods that will be created.
No database is needed, functionality should not store any data. It should receive passenger data, calculate price, and return result.
Acceptance criteria:
Given:
- The base price for route to Vilnius, Lithuania is 10 EUR
- Two passengers:
o Adult carrying two bags
o Child carrying one bag
- Tax rates on given date are:
o VAT = 21
Result should be:
- Ticket prices:
o Adult (10 EUR + 21%) = 12.10 EUR
o Two bags (2 x 10 EUR x 30% + 21%) = 7.26 EUR
o Infant (10 EUR x 50% + 21%) = 6.05 EUR
o One bag (10 EUR x 30% + 21%) = 3.63 EUR
- Total price = 29.04 EUR
